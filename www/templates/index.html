    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        This web application was developed for the <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/201/ask-ubuntu-general-room">Ask Ubuntu General Room</a> by <a href="https://github.com/nathan-osman">Nathan Osman</a> based on an idea by one of the moderators. Here is a basic overview of what the application does:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the <a href="http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/201">chat transcript</a> is scraped at regular intervals</li>
        <li>messages are evaluated and awesome ones are selected</li>
        <li>registered users select interesting ones and queue them</li>
        <li>every so often, a queued message is tweeted</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        For the curious, the entire application is available <a href="https://github.com/AskUbuntu/tbot">on GitHub</a>.
    </p>
